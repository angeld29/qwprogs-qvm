don't use double in mod (qvm don't support it)

do not modify progdefs.h and g_public.h


use PROG_TO_EDICT ,EDICT_TO_PROG  for work with (gedict_t)->s.v entity fields (like .owner,.enemy)

map entites describes in tables :
field_t         fields[]
spawn_t         spawns[]
in g_spawn.c

for missiles spawn need set g_globalvars.newmis
